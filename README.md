## Description

Spindrift displays a dashboard of the following components, refreshed hourly:
- Surf forecast from Magicseaweed
- Weather forecast from Google
- Live cam streams from user-specified sources (e.g., Surfline)

As a bit of background on the `.m3u8` HLS live cam streams that Spindrift displays, here's a condensed explanation from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U):
> M3U is a plain text computer file format for a multimedia playlist that specifies the locations of one or more media files. The M3U file can also include comments, prefaced by the "#" character.
> - In extended M3U, "#" also introduces extended M3U directives which are terminated by a colon ":" if they support parameters.
> - The Unicode version of M3U is M3U8, which uses UTF-8-encoded characters.
>
> Extended M3U8 files are the basis for HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), a format originally developed by Apple to stream video and radio to iOS devices, and later standardized by the IETF. In HLS, a master playlist references segment playlists which usually contain URLs for short parts of the media stream.

### Features

- Fetches hourly forecast data with Playwright (headless Chrome) scheduled in a cron job
- Renders the forecast, along with live cam streams, in Chrome running in kiosk mode and controlled by DevTools Protocol on a standalone X server
- Runs on a "headless" Raspberry Pi controlled remotely via SSH
- (Optional) Displays on an old, beautiful, hacked Apple iMac G4 17" 1440x900 px

### Built with

- Chromium
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev)
- [WebSocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat)
- [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq)
- X server

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

If needed, [install Raspbian](https://github.com/noperator/guides/blob/master/install_raspbian.md).

### Install

Clone this repo and run the installer script.
```
git clone https://github.com/noperator/spindrift && cd spindrift
./install.sh
```

This'll do a few things:
- Install [dependencies](#built-with)
- Schedule cron jobs
  - Start at boot
  - Schedule hourly forecast refresh
  - Turn off display from 10 PMâ€“8 AM (presumably while not in use)

### Configure

Specify your surf spot and weather location in the `config.toml` config file. For example, pull the string `Ala-Moana-Surf-Report/661/` from Ala Moana's surf forecast URL `https://magicseaweed.com/Ala-Moana-Surf-Report/661/`.

```
spot = "Ala-Moana-Surf-Report/661/"
locaion = "Waikiki HI"
```

Configure `config/streams.js` with the HLS live cam streams you'd like to display.

```
"priority": "1",
"url":      "<URL>",
"title":    "Ala Moana Bowls",
"source":   "Surfline"
```

Note that this was developed with a 1440 x 900 px display in mind. If you need to make any display adjustments, you may do so in `screenshot-*.js`, `launch.sh`, and `style.css`.

### Usage

The kiosk will launch automatically when you boot the Raspberry Pi, but you can also start it manually:

```
./startx.sh
```

You can also manually refresh it:

```
./refresh.sh
```

### Troubleshooting

If needed, fix `startx` error, "Only console users are allowed to run the X server."

```
sudo sed -i -E 's/(allowed_users=)console/\1anybody/' /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config
```

### To-do

- [ ] Turn off display signal while sleeping, rather than blanking it
- [x] Add weather report
- [x] Load backup streams in order of preference
- [x] Merge screenshot scripts
- [ ] Consolidate config files into a single JavaScript file, if possible
- [ ] Manually rotate through streams
